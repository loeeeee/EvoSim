# Octopus Net

Octopus Net is a neural architecture, crafted specifically for our blobs, ensures adaptability without compromising integrity. 
## Granular & Hierarchical Structure:

-  **Peripheral Neural Units (PNU):** Associated with every block of the blob, these are the smallest computational units. Each PNU processes sensory input unique to its respective block and issues commands to its specific joint motor. This allows for autonomous decision-making at a micro level.
-  **Central Brain (CB):** Positioned in the root block, the CB operates as a coordinator. It receives sensory information from all blocks, processes it, and emits overarching commands. These signals can modify or influence behaviors across all blocks, ensuring coordination.

## Signal Transmission & Behavior Modulation:

- **Bottom-up Transmission:** PNUs send specific sensory information hierarchially to the CB. This aids in holistic decision-making by the CB, considering inputs from all over the blob's body.
- **Top-down Modulation:** The CB issues general commands to it children blocks, and hierarchially passes to every block. While a block's PNU makes independent decisions, these decisions are modulated based on its parents' overarching signals, ensuring harmony in the blob's behavior.

## Advantages:

- **Decentralized Processing:** Like an octopus, where each tentacle can act semi-independently but is influenced by a central brain, the blob benefits from a blend of localized decision-making and coordinated control.
- **Adaptability:** If a block or limb gets mutated or is non-functional, its corresponding PNU gets impacted, but the overall neural architecture remains resilient. The CB can adjust its strategies based on inputs from functioning PNUs.
- **Evolutionary Fitness:** In the world of virtual evolution, Octopus Net's modular design ensures that mutations affecting one part don't lead to the complete breakdown of the entire neural system, offering better survival and adaptability chances.

## Flat vs. Hierarchical: A Comparative Discussion

When we ponder the design of Neural Processing Units (NPU) in our blobs, two structural possibilities emerge: maintaining a hierarchical tree structure or adopting a flattened approach where all NPUs directly interface with the Central Brain (CB). Both designs have their own merits and challenges:

### Hierarchical

Strengths:

- **Mutation Resilience:** This design showcases superior resilience to structural mutations. Whether a limb is gained or lost, the CB remains unaffected in terms of its structural integrity and functioning.
- **Harmonized Decision-Making:** The hierarchical structure supports synchronized decision-making. Each node emits general commands to its immediate descendants. As a result, the CB can release broad directives without being entangled in the intricacies of specific block levels.

Challenges:

- **Signal Distortion:** As signals traverse a labyrinth of nodes before reaching the CB, they can get distorted. This limits the CB's ability to accurately gauge stimuli from distal blocks, potentially making the blob less responsive to subtle, yet vital cues.
- **Processing Complexities:** Given the intertwined dependencies within NPUs, some function almost as mini-brains, reliant on outputs from other NPUs. This can complicate parallel processing efforts, delaying responses.

### Flat

Strengths:

- **Simpler Parallel Processing:** Absence of internal NPU dependencies enables simultaneous processing of all NPUs. This can lead to faster reactions and adaptability.
- **Clearer Signal Transmission:** Direct connections to the CB eliminate the long circuitous paths of the hierarchical setup. This means that the CB receives more pristine, less-distorted signals, enhancing its sensitivity to nuanced stimuli.

Challenges:

- **Lack of Gradation:** While signals are clearer, there's a potential loss in the depth and gradation of information. Everything is relayed directly to the CB, which could overwhelm it with a barrage of data.
- **Inconstant CB structure:** Due to the direct linkage, the BC's shape and size changes while morphyological mutation happens, which might leads to a wide disable of blocks.

### Conclusion & Our Choice

In conclusion, the Octopus Net offers a harmonious blend of decentralization and coordination, drawing inspiration from nature's evolutionary marvels and tailoring it to the unique requirements of our virtual blobs.
